# Community Rules

## Rule A1: Do not commit explicit sexual or erotic acts {#a1-erp}

Do not say or do sexually explicit or erotic things.

- No sexual content/themes including erotic roleplay (ERP) is allowed on this server.
- Insults, vague teasing and such is generally allowed as long as it isn't explicit. For example saying "Yeah we fuck everyday" as a joke is acceptable, but anything more detailed or explanatory is explicitly forbidden. Use the Admin Help (F1) chat if you have any doubts regarding this rule.
- <span style="color: #ff0000;">If roleplay reaches a point where it has become sexual and/or uncomfortable, immediately stop and contact an administrator or moderator.</span>

### Examples:

#### Allowed:

- Insults such as calling someone a dickhead or telling someone to "shove it up your ass".
- Being affectionate in a mutually consensual way.
- Kissing, hand-holding, dates and non-sexual physical touch.

#### Prohibited:

- Emoting sexual acts.
- Erotica content.

## Rule A2: Follow our chat guidelines and be respectful {#a2-community}

Quantum Blue is an English-based Community;

- Use English as your primary method of communication within the game.
- Do not spam or advertise on our server.
- Be respectful towards other members and avoid making others uncomfortable.
    - Usage of LOOC and OOC channels to cope, mald and seethe are strictly forbidden. <span style="color: #ff0000;">We WILL blow you up.</span>
- We have a zero tolerance policy for racism, sexism, homophobia, violence, threats, hate speech, slurs, and other forms of bigotry, discrimination, and harassment.
    - <span style="color: #ff0000;">Failure to comply with this rule will result in community removal.</span>

## Rule A3: Rules regarding sharing in-round information {#a3-streaming}

Quantum Blue welcomes content creators and streamers to our community, but we have a few rules regarding livestreaming game servers.

- While a stream delay is not necessary, it is highly recommended to have at least a 10 second delay.
- Please let admins know you are streaming via the AHelp prior to doing so.
- If your chat or viewers are in-game with you while also watching your stream, they are breaking our server rules.
- Please do not coordinate with them and discourage this behavior if it is seen.
- Streaming to places such as Discord is allowed, as long as your viewers are not in the same round.

### Regarding text channels in external applications or use of LOOC, or otherwise voice communications through external means:

- Similar rules still apply: Sharing explicit information about a round with people who are in it is forbidden.
- Using LOOC to share in-round information is also explicitly forbidden and WILL have repercussions. For example, being converted by a Cosmic Cultist and using LOOC to say "I knew it was cosmic cult".

## Rule A4: Engage in proper AHelp etiquette {#a4-ahelp}

The Ahelp (F1) chat is for contacting admins. We are a small server with a small staff, so please be patient if we can't respond right away.

- Intentionally disconnecting, responding with hostility, or refusing to respond when an admin privately messages you in-game may be met with a ban.
- Additionally, abusing the AHelp relay by flooding it with garbage similarly may result in a ban.
- All AHelp messages are relayed to the Quantum Blue Discord. Just because your AHelp was not answered does not mean we cannot see it. If your problem isn't resolved in a round please feel free to contact an admin directly via our Discord.

## Rule A5: Do not exploit the game {#a5-exploits}

Do not exploit the game, use cheats or macros.

The usage of:

- any third party applications/scripts/client modifications,
- any other applicable software to gain an advantage, avoid intended game/server mechanics, or to harm server infrastructure is strictly prohibited.
- the abuse of known glitches, exploits and bugs.

!!! warning
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">Depending on the severity of the exploit you may be permanently ban without a warning.</span>
