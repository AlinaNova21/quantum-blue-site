# Server Rules

## Overview {#overview}

!!! warning
    **Age Requirement:** You must be at least 18 years of age to play on this server. Any attempts to avoid this restriction may result in a ban without warning.

!!! info
    **Roleplay Level:** This is a medium roleplaying (MRP) server. You are expected to try to roleplay a character and immerse yourself in the world with the other players. Whether listed in the rules below or not, administrators may intervene to assist in the flow of roleplay in any way they see fit.

This server is also welcoming to new players! Spacestation is a nerdy roleplaying game and rules may not be so intuitive, so please take your time reading the rules below and don't be afraid to use the Admin Help (AHelp) chat by pressing F1 if you have any questions.
