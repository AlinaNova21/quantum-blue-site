# Role Rules

## Rule C1: Command, Security and Justice Guidelines {#c1-command-security}

While admins may have more leniency with other roles, Command, Security and Justice are almost like "Dungeon Masters" in Space Station 14, you get to influence the round's flow, pacing and everybody's enjoyment of it a lot more than other roles, so make sure to act accordingly.

- Your character has a mindshield and must act like such, with unquestioned loyalty to Nanotrasen.
    - Your character is presumed to be sane, competent in their duties, and able to make decisions to the benefit of the station.
    - Giving away Traitor objective items and sensitive equipment should be avoided in these roles. Your character should value them deeply.
        - Leeway is given to making deals with criminals if the deal benefits the safety or situation of the crew and station OR if the deal involves items of a primarily sentimental value (e.g. HoP's Ian scrapbook, LO's lucky dollar).
        - Leeway can be given in <span style="color: #ff0000;">extreme circumstances</span> of emergency/crisis.
- The three departments are required to read and follow Quantum Blue Space Law, Standard Operating Procedure and Alert Procedure with good intent. Circumstances may appear where violating these documents is accidental or unavoidable, this is appropriate as long as they are making an effort to roleplay and follow the documents to the best of their known ability.
    - <span style="color: #ff0000;">Circumstances and context may permit you to break these laws. However, the fact that this rule is malleable is not an excuse to ignore it entirely.</span>
    - Your character is expected to uphold the law and maintain order aboard the station. Do not engage in lawbreaking activity or troublemaker behavior, and ensure all laws are followed whenever possible.
    - Security is expected to intervene in criminal activity where possible and safe to do so.
    - Heads of departments are at minimum expected to report criminal activity to Security and should cooperate with law enforcement where possible.
- Do not hire random crew to be your bodyguard(s) or promote random crewmembers to Command positions at random. If you require bodyguards or security details, talk to your Security department. If you need new Command staff, talk to the personnel in that related department.
- If you need to leave the round, notify your fellow crew via departmental radio and put your equipment in its proper places prior to going to cryo.

## Rule C2: Antagonist Guidelines {#c2-antags}

<span style="color: #ffff00;">Being an antagonist does not allow you to stop playing a character. Determine how your character would react to being given these objectives, and work through it appropriately.</span>

Just because you're an antagonist doesn't mean you should ignore Rule 0. You are allowed to play to win, but please make sure you're doing so in a way that is fun for everybody. If you're winning in a way that feels cheap or ruining the round for somebody you're probably doing it wrong.

- <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antagonists are free to complete their objectives through committing proportional damage. Through roleplay, damage becomes more proportional.</span> Example: Holding the singulo hostage for a theft objective is acceptable, while simply singuloosing and using that chaos is not.
    - Killing players unrelated to your immediate objective in a manner that results in their round removal should be avoided. Crew that do not make an attempt at self preservation, or engage in valid-hunting, are exempt from this.
    - Round-ending or potentially round-ending antagonists such as Initial Infected, Nuclear Operatives or Cosmic Cultists are usually exempt from this.
    - If you are concerned as to whether or not what you're about to do is allowed, feel free to ask through the AHelp (F1) chat and ask an admin for clarification. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lack of administrator response does not constitute approval.</span>
    - You should not abuse the power of your role to be a clown solely because you know you can't be caught or killed. Nuclear Operatives or Lone Operatives must still roleplay as deadly terrorists and Space Ninjas must roleplay as stealth-oriented saboteurs. Exceedingly egregious violations of this rule may result in immediate admin action without warning.
- While antagonists are <span style="color: #ffff00;">not required</span> to complete their objectives, they are still encouraged to act as an antagonist in the round while roleplaying.
- Other antagonists are not necessarily your friends. Other antagonists are often free agents that you may negotiate with at your own risk.
    - If you are a team antagonist, you must work with your partners to complete any shared objectives.
- No antagonist may loiter or camp around the arrivals or cryosleep areas of the station for the purposes of antagonist action towards newly-spawning players.
- Antagonists should not seek to extend the length of the round unreasonably. Feel free to ask admins through the Ahelp (F1) chat if you're ever not sure about this one.
- Antagonists may not bring the round to a close without in-character or objective-related justification as a result of their antagonistic action. While this is largely subjective because different command may react differently, it's important to not engage in potentially round-ending behavior without reason.
