# Crimes and Sentencing Guide

## Overview

Members of station security are authorized to sentence non-capital crimes, given good probable cause is found. When a suspect is detained they must be informed of their suspected charges and informed of what evidence the charge is based upon. A detainee cannot be held awaiting sentencing or charged with a capital offense for more than 5 minutes. A non-capital sentence must also not exceed 25 minutes. Check the [Controlled Items](controlled-items.md) page for details on possession charges.

If a capital offense is suspected by security, a trial or adjudication must be held to confirm the charges given the availability of a valid judge while the suspect is held in confinement. This procedure is detailed in the [Judicial Procedures](judicial.md) section.
