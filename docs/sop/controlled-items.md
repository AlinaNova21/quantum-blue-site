# Controlled Items

Controlled items are dangerous items whose use on stations should be monitored carefully, and may be authorized to select groups or individuals. Possession of these items without a license is a crime, with varying prison times depending on the severity and risk of the item.

## Contraband Technology {#contraband-technology}

The following technology is controlled and requires authorization from the listed department head:

Additionally, any equipment or technology providing insight into the development, production, or procurement of a controlled item is also controlled in and of itself.

## Chemicals {#chemicals}

## Licenses {#licenses}

Any individual requiring any controlled item in the course of their job, or for regular function, may request a document of authorization, or license, from the relevant departmental head. Weapons and armor may be licensed by the HOS or warden, chemicals may be licensed by the CMO, and most other items may be licensed by the CE or MG as relevant. A license must have an itemized list of the approved Controlled Items, the name and position of the holder, and a signed and stamped statement by the authorizing party.

Should the holder commit crimes through the use of such authorized items, the authorizing party may be found guilty of Accessory to said crimes, in addition to Endangerment and Abuse of Power where applicable. The Commanding Officer is also authorized to supervise the approval and revocation of documentation as they see fit.

## Departmental Dispensation {#departmental-dispensation}

Some jobs may require certain Controlled Items in the course of their duties, and as such are provided exceptions.

Any department member with access to a controlled item via their department area, including their departmental lathe, is assumed authorized for its possession and use.

Additionally, tools and equipment located within emergency lockers are not considered Controlled Items.

Medical staff are authorized to administer controlled substances with direct approval by the CMO. Any class I or II chemicals are to be given to chemistry for safe disposal, and are not to be stored without an explicit license from the CMO.
