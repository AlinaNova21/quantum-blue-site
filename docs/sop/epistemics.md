# Epistemics Procedures

## Sophont Experimentation {#sophont-experimentation}

Any sophont experimentation must be done with the consent of the test subject, and must not have an undue risk of life. The Mystagogue or CO may terminate any experiment for safety or ethical purposes and at their discretion.

## Sentient Artifacts {#sentient-artifacts}

Sentient artifacts are not protected by sophont status and may be disposed of by typical means as necessary, including crushing, as a last resort to protect the station.
