# Security Procedures

## Overview {#overview}

Security is expected to:

- Maintain safe functioning of the station by elimination of pests.
- Enforce SOP with appropriate charges.
- Inform arrestees of their charges.
- Detain with minimum necessary force.
- Respect the rights of prisoners.
- Search detainees and store evidence and possessions safely.
- Inform department heads of criminal behavior of employees.

## Arrest Procedure {#arrest-procedure}

An arrest of a suspect may be done with "probable cause". Probable cause to believe a suspect has committed a crime is achieved when: a credible witness report is given, such that the individual has the means and ability to perform the crime reported, and was present at the crime scene OR an officer has witnessed the crime in action. Probable cause is also given when the only possible explanation for something occurring is that the individual to be searched was in possession of contraband.

For a suspect to be under arrest, they MUST first be hailed and informed of their charges.

If a suspect does not stop and ignores attempts to be hailed, security is then allowed to forcibly stop the suspect via nonlethal methods.

## Brig Procedure {#brig-procedure}

When confining an Arrestee within the Brig, they should be transferred to the Warden or a Prison Guard for processing:

- A full search of the Arrestee and their possessions.
- The confiscation of any Controlled Items or items used in commission of the crime, along with any equipment not befitting a prisoner, such as tools or weapons.
- The confining of the Arrestee within a temporary holding cell.
- Sentencing the Arrestee.

If the Arrestee is sentenced for a Capital-level crime, they are to be transferred to the Permanent Brig, pending trial. If the Warden is unavailable, the arresting officer must process the Arrestee as stated above. All confiscated items must be stored within a corresponding evidence locker, or in a contraband crate within the armory.

Prisoner possessions must be returned at the end of their sentence, and are the responsibility of the arresting officer to store securely.

## Sentencing {#sentencing}

Any officer is authorized to sentence non-capital crimes. Multiple crimes within the same category do not accumulate. "Stacking" charges is not permitted. Only the most severe charge is to be sentenced.

**Example:** A detainee is searched and found in possession of 3 breaching charges, jaws of life, and a python revolver. The most severe item, in this case, is the category D breaching charge, so they would be sentenced to 15 minutes.

Improper sentencing may incur Abuse of Power charges.

## Rules of Engagement {#rules-of-engagement}

Law enforcement personnel hold an unrestricted Armaments License, and are authorized at all times to use lethal force to the extent necessary to neutralize adversaries under any of the following circumstances:

- If the adversary's number or strength leave the officer at a severe tactical disadvantage.
- If the adversary exhibits a clear and present danger to the vessel by physical means.
- If the adversary poses a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to the officer or others.
- If the adversary cannot be reasonably subdued through non-lethal means without great bodily harm to the officer.

â€¦wherein an "adversary" is an entity that demonstrates a hostile intent, commits or directly contributes to a hostile act that does not constitute an actual attack, or is actively attacking the vessel or its crew.

Despite their allowance of lethal force, Security is required to follow the Rules of Engagement of the current Alert Level, as outlined within Alert Procedure.

## Armory Procedure {#armory-procedure}

The Warden is responsible for stocking, distributing, and recording the collection of weapons used by the station during the shift. They are also afforded the authority to arm security at their discretion, so long as the weaponry distributed is in appropriate response to Alert Procedure.

While issued, the weaponry remains as station property, and the wielder assumes a duty to protect the weapon and return it to the Warden when ordered. No non-crew may be issued weaponry from the armory.

Any weaponry issued during a heightened alert level must be returned when the alert has been lowered, or when the threat is no longer present. The weaponry issued must be proportionate to the threat posed, and explosives should not be used unless absolutely necessary.

## Treatment of Prisoners {#treatment-of-prisoners}

Prisoners must have access to food, water, clothing, medical care, legal counsel, prison radio, safe containment, and freedom of movement.

Prisoners in extended confinement may have visitors, as approved by the warden. Visitors are subject to a search before entering permanent confinement.

Prisoners that repeatedly attempt to escape, or cause harm to other prisoners or officers may have their sentence elevated to preservative stasis. The prisoner's life signs are terminated, and the body is kept preserved in a body bag or the morgue. In the event that a prisoner is put into preservative stasis, Central Command should be notified via fax or otherwise.
