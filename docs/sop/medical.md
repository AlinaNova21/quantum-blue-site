# Medical Procedures

## Chemical Storage {#chemical-storage}

Chemicals are to be stored within a secure locker or crate, and labelled, including the overdose amount.

## Surgery Protocols {#surgery-protocols}

Superficial or voluntary surgeries must be approved by the CMO.

Surgeons must perform anesthesia and sterilize tools to minimize risk.

## Suit Sensors {#suit-sensors}

While suit sensors are encouraged, they are not mandatory, and medical professionals should not threaten, coerce, or activate sensors without consent.

## Do Not Revive (DNR) Policy {#dnr-policy}

A crew member may be designated as "Do Not Revive" (DNR) if:

- They were lawfully executed
- Sentenced to preservative stasis
- Committed suicide in custody
- If the patient refuses medical treatment
- If the CMO deems medical treatment wasteful or unfeasible.

## Quarantine Procedures {#quarantine}

Medical staff may also quarantine infectious individuals within virology or intensive care units to monitor their treatment closely. In such cases, medical staff should wear biosuits and sterilize themselves upon entering and exiting the quarantine area. Security may be notified to enforce quarantine.

## Mental Evaluations {#mental-evaluations}

The CMO or psychologist may perform a mental evaluation to determine a crew member to be unfit for duty, including the commanding officer, who may not overrule their decision.

The CMO must review the assessment and notify the corresponding head of staff, or central command and proceed with demotion.
